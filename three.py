Optimization: Improve lookup from O(n) to O(log n)

When constructing the list that contains all three-letter words, the order is
determined by the order of the text file that was used as input. A relatively
straightforward optimization consists of sorting that list, and then using
binary search for the lookup. Given that a large number of permutations of
â€˜phraseâ€™ are not actual English words, an unsorted list would hit the worst
case of O(n) frequently.

However, by ordering the list of values, binary search can be used to look up
potential words, which happens in O(log n).
